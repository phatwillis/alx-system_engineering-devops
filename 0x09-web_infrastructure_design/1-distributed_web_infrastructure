1. For every additional element, why you are adding it:
   - Ensure each addition aligns with system objectives, such as scalability or redundancy, optimizing functionality.

2. Distribution algorithm your load balancer is configured with and how it works:
   - Load balancer distributes requests among servers using algorithms like Round Robin or Least Connections, optimizing resource utilization.

3. Load-balancer enabling an Active-Active or Active-Passive setup, explain the difference between both:
   - Active-Active utilizes all servers simultaneously, enhancing scalability, while Active-Passive designates one active server, providing redundancy with backups.

4. How a database Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) cluster works:
   - Primary node handles write operations and maintains data integrity, while replica nodes serve read queries and provide redundancy.

5. Difference between the Primary node and the Replica node in regard to the application:
   - Primary node manages data modifications, ensuring integrity, while replica nodes serve read operations, enhancing scalability and redundancy.
