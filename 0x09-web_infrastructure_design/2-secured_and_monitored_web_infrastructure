1. For every additional element, why you are adding it:
   - Additional elements are added to meet specific requirements such as increased capacity, redundancy, or improved performance.

2. What are firewalls for:
   - Firewalls are designed to control and filter network traffic, enforcing security policies to protect against unauthorized access and threats.

3. Why is the traffic served over HTTPS:
   - Traffic is served over HTTPS to ensure secure communication by encrypting data exchanged between the client and server, mitigating the risk of interception and unauthorized access.

4. What monitoring is used for:
   - Monitoring is used to track and analyze system performance, detect anomalies, ensure availability, and troubleshoot issues to maintain optimal operation.

5. How the monitoring tool is collecting data:
   - The monitoring tool collects data by periodically querying system metrics, logs, and performance indicators from servers, applications, and network devices, aggregating information for analysis and reporting.

6. Explain what to do if you want to monitor your web server QPS:
   - To monitor your web server's QPS (queries per second), you can deploy monitoring software that tracks incoming requests, configure it to capture relevant metrics, and analyze the data to gauge server performance and capacity.
