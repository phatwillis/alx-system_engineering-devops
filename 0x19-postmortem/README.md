#Issue Summary:
- Duration: The outage occurred from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM (UTC-4) on May 15, 2024.
- Impact: The outage affected the availability of our e-commerce website, resulting in slow loading times and intermittent errors for approximately 30% of our users.
-  Root Cause: The root cause of the outage was identified as a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings, leading to an uneven distribution of traffic across backend servers.

##Timeline:
- **10:00 AM:** The issue was detected when the monitoring system triggered an alert for increased latency on the website.
- **10:05 AM:** Engineers noticed a spike in error rates and slow response times while investigating the issue.
- **10:30 AM:** Initial investigation focused on backend server performance and database connectivity issues.
- **10:45 AM:** Further analysis revealed discrepancies in traffic distribution among backend servers.
- **11:00 AM:** The incident was escalated to the DevOps team for a more in-depth investigation.
- **11:30 AM:** After reviewing load balancer configurations, the misconfiguration was identified as the root cause.
- **12:00 PM:** The misconfiguration was corrected, and normal website functionality was restored.

##Root Cause and Resolution:
- **Root Cause:** The misconfiguration in the load balancer settings resulted in an uneven distribution of traffic, causing some backend servers to be overwhelmed while others remained underutilized.
- **Resolution:** The misconfiguration was corrected by adjusting the load balancer settings to evenly distribute traffic across all backend servers. Additionally, monitoring alerts were configured to notify engineers of any future discrepancies in traffic distribution.

##Corrective and Preventative Measures:
- **Improvements/Fixes:**
  - Regular audits of load balancer configurations to ensure consistency and accuracy.
  - Implementation of automated testing for load balancer settings to detect misconfigurations proactively.
  - Improved documentation and communication protocols for rapid response to similar incidents in the future.
- **Tasks to Address the Issue:**
  - Conduct a comprehensive review of all load balancer configurations to identify and rectify any additional misconfigurations.
  - Implement redundancy measures to mitigate the impact of future load balancer failures.
  - Schedule regular training sessions for DevOps team members to enhance their troubleshooting skills and familiarity with system components.

By implementing these corrective and preventative measures, we aim to minimize the risk of similar outages in the future and ensure the continued reliability and performance of our e-commerce platform.
